<p>The intent for Rational Accelrationism is to be more than just the contents of this static essay. Like any philosophy or school of thought, it requires active work and a community to uphold its principles. This will require collaboration, open-source work, and advocacy for both safetists and accelrationists to meet in the middle. </p>
